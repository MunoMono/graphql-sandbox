### Welcome

This sandbox demonstrates how a design museum API can operate as a digital doorway into archives and special collections. It takes inspiration from the **Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum’s public API**, which makes its collection searchable by object, designer, exhibition, material, and colour. The Cooper Hewitt exemplar shows how structured data plus openly licensed multimedia can power research, teaching, and public discovery at scale. 

This project adapts that model as a **proof of concept for the Royal College of Art’s Department of Design Research (DDR) archive**, working in dialogue with the V&A East Storehouse. By prototyping a GraphQL API around a critical taxonomy of DDR materials, we test how archival records can be activated as a living research infrastructure. The DDR archive (1972–1980) captures a paradigmatic moment in the history of design research

### Why this matters

- Visibility: APIs extend the reach of archives to global audiences, scholars, and creative coders.  
- Innovation: They support teaching, experimentation, and new design tools that reuse collections data.  
- Preservation: Structured metadata and open standards protect fragile research records for long-term access.  
- Legacy: Research outputs become reusable infrastructures rather than static documents.  

> Tip: Explore the **Try it out** section to run real GraphQL queries against Cooper Hewitt’s API, and imagine how a similar endpoint could one day serve the RCA DDR archive.
